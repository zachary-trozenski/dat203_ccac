### Pivot Table Homework

Using the Greater Hazelwood Community Census data provided by Eric, we examined the data to answer some questions regarding the people who live in Hazelwood, how they feel about their community, and aspects they might change.

My pivot tables are in a [private Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XyjYm8MELD2tGLLmwshnsMFnwJ99CFjpL5SmS4xF5fk/edit#gid=665205376) which I can share upon request. The questions and the original data are from [Eric's website](https://technologyrediscovery.net/data/vis/dat203_schedule_fa20.html)
