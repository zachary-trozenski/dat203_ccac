### Factor Tracker

**Overview**

This document has been designed to track the various factors I've decided to track for my Visualize Yourself project. Please see the factor model for more information on the factors being tracked.

There are several components of the tracker:
* Tracker - contains the raw data
* Dictionary - definitions of the sub-fields/factors being tracker
* Scales - definitions and values of the scales used
* Log - work log tracking edits for the tracker
