## Factor Model for Visualize Yourself Project

### Description
For this factor model I wanted to attempt to capture the myriad of variables that may affect the quality of sleep. I wanted to create a binary between pre-sleep activities while also acknowledging the other factors that may also have a large affect.

### Major Factor categories
The major categories are intended to organize individual factors. The factors I'm accounting for are (as well as their measurement method):
* Screen time
    * TV
        * Watching TV or a movie before bed, in minutes
    * Computer
        * Using a laptop before bed, in minutes
    * Phone
        * Scrolling through various apps on phone, in minutes
* Reading print
