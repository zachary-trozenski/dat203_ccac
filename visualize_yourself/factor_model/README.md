## Factor Model for Visualize Yourself Project

### Central Question
What affect do pre-sleep activities have on the quality of my sleep?

### Description
For this factor model I wanted to attempt to capture the myriad of variables that may affect the quality of sleep. I wanted to create more distinctions between pre-sleep activities while also acknowledging the other factors that may also have a large affect.

### Major Factor categories
The major categories are intended to organize individual factors. The factors I'm accounting for are (as well as their measurement method):
* Screen time
    * TV
        * Watching TV or a movie before bed, in minutes
    * Computer
        * Using a laptop before bed, in minutes
    * Phone
        * Scrolling through various apps on phone, in minutes
* Reading print
    * Books
        * Novels or other printed and bound works, in minutes
    * Comic books
        * Individual issues or collected volumes, in minutes
    * Newspapers
        * Alt weeklies or mainstream publications, in minutes
* Health
    * Stress/Anxiety
        * External factors contributing to mental wellbeing, scale value
    * Emotional fatigue
        * Measurement of feeling "drained" emotionally, scale value
    * Healthy vs Ill
        * Binary measurement, suffering from ailment or healthy
* Food/Drink
    * Caffeince Intake
        * Amount of cups consumed per day
    * Alcohol
        * Binary, consumed or not
    * Meal times (late vs earlier)
        * Time value of when dinner was eaten

    * ~Child care~
        * ~Daily estimated measuremtn of child care in hours~
    * ~Housework~
        * ~Daily estimated measurement of housework in hours~
