## DAT-203: Data Visualization and Business Intelligence 

### Vidualize Yourself - Final Project

### Abstract

There is broad concesus among doctors and scientists regarding the effect of blue light emitting from electronic devices having a negative impact on sleep quality. The Sleep Foundation conducted a [poll in 2011](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SIAP_2011_Summary_of_Findings.pdf?x95607&x14342) which found that a significant proportion of adults used electronic devices before going to bed. Poor sleep quality has a demonstrably negative effect on overall health and, as noted by the UK's National Health Service, can lead to [obesity, cardio-vascular disease, diabetes, and even lower life expectancy.](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sleep-and-tiredness/why-lack-of-sleep-is-bad-for-your-health/)
The purpose of this project is to take a snapshot of my own sleep quality and identify whether or not screen time is affecting the quality of sleep I experience. I'm hoping that the results of this data collection and the subsequent analysis will be able to dictact any behavior changes in my life. Additionally, one of the goals I'm hoping to achieve is designing, analyzing, and executing a time study of my own. This would be a valuable experience and a different experience for me, as I've mostly stuck to analyzing existing data sets.

### Goals

My goals for this project are:

* Design a data collection schema and define a data dictionary
* Produce compelling graphics to visualize the data collected
* Combine the graphics with analysis of data set
* Use the visualizations and analysis to make a data backed claim

### Method

In order to aggregate observations for this project I designed a spreadsheet to log the data. I set the spreadsheet up in a way that mimicked a time series with all values indexed by a particular date. In order to best use statistical tools and R, I designed that values in a given time series to be integers, referring either to time in minutes, hourly time, scale values, or a binary. I felt that this design would lend itself to better processing. The scales are defined in the [data dictionary]()
